Description: JAML (Just Another Markup Language or Jedd's Awesome Markup Language :P) is a markup language very similar to Markdown but with a syntax I find a bit nicer to write. I wouldn't recommend any one use this parser and it's probably only 90% working (there are edge cases where indentation of bullets don't work quite right). The syntax is as follows:
    _emphasize_
    ~strong~
    ("link" www.google.com)
    headers are the same as markdown
    @ denotes an ordered list
    * denotes an unordered list
    --- (or more) denotes a horizontal rule
    `inline code`
